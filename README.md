# Real-Tactics-Soccer

Just a hobby project being developed on the Unity Game Engine with C# as script language. Mainly because I find it fun, but also to keep my coding mind fresh while I look for a job as a software developer.

The idea is to make a XCOM like turn-based tactics game, but instead of shooting bullets my guys will kick a soccer ball.
